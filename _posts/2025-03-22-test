# Welcome to My Academic Journey

Hello everyone! I wanted to share a bitabout my current academic journey at University College London (UCL), where I'm pursuing my Master's in Information Security with a specialization in Cryptography and Cryptocurrency.

## My Master's Thesis Project

I'm currently working on my master's thesis in collaboration with Mysten Labs, focusing on a "Dual Mode DAG-Based Consensus Protocol." This exciting project explores innovative approaches to blockchain consensus mechanisms, specifically leveraging Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structures to improve scalability and efficiency.

The research aims to develop a protocol that can operate in two distinct modes, adapting to network conditions and transaction volumes to optimize performance. Working with Mysten Labs has provided invaluable industry insights and practical applications for theoretical concepts.

## Learning Experience at UCL

The Information Security program at UCL has been an incredible journey of discovery. The curriculum balances theoretical foundations with practical applications, allowing me to develop a comprehensive understanding of security principles, cryptographic protocols, and blockchain technologies.

The collaborative environment at UCL encourages interdisciplinary thinking, which has been crucial for my research. Engaging with professors who are leaders in their fields and peers with diverse backgrounds has broadened my perspective and enhanced my approach to problem-solving.

I look forward to sharing more about my research findings and academic experiences as I progress through this journey!
