# Introduction
This is a short write-up on Firo, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that caught my attention recently. Firo (previously known as ZCoin) aims to provide high levels of financial privacy without sacrificing trustlessness. What makes it interesting is how they've solved some fundamental problems that other privacy coins have.

# Why Firo Matters
Most cryptocurrencies have a privacy problem. Bitcoin transactions are completely public. Anyone can trace your entire transaction history if they know one of your addresses. Even "privacy" coins often require trusted setups or have other compromises.

Firo takes a different approach. They've built a system that provides strong privacy guarantees while maintaining the trustless properties we expect from cryptocurrencies.

## No Trusted Setup Required
Firo's Spark Transaction Protocol doesn't need a trusted setup. This is huge because trusted setups are always a potential point of failure (i.e. for example, **Zcash** requires a trusted setup). If the setup is compromised, the entire system's privacy can be broken.

## Large Anonymity Sets
Firo achieves large anonymity sets of $2^{16}$ through a sliding window mechanism. Instead of starting fresh with each anonymity set, they overlap them so new sets are never "empty." You're always mixing with a substantial number of other transactions.

## Groth-Bootle Proofs
The system uses Groth-Bootle One-out-of-Many proofs. These are zero-knowledge proofs that allow you to burn and redeem Firo coins of arbitrary size while keeping the change hidden. You don't leak information about transaction amounts.

## IP Address Protection
Firo implements Dandelion++, a protocol that hides the IP addresses used for transactions. This closes another potential privacy leak that many systems ignore.

# How Spark Works
The core of Firo's privacy comes from their Spark Transaction Protocol. It's similar to what Monero does but with some improvements.

Spark addresses consist of a tuple of three keys:
$$
(addr_{in}, addr_{full}, addr_{sk})
$$

These keys work together to let you generate any number of diversified public addresses from a single Spark address. These diversified addresses are indistinguishable from each other. Even if someone knows one of your addresses, they can't link it to your other addresses.

Here's how the protocol flows:

</div>
<br/>

The process:

1. **Create Address**: Your Spark address generates a diversified public address using $addr_{in}$ and some index $i$
2. **Create Coin**: When someone sends you Firo, they create a coin associated with your diversified address
3. **Mint**: The coin gets minted into the anonymity set
4. **Identify**: Your Spark address can identify which coins belong to you
5. **Recover**: You can recover the coin information
6. **Spend**: You can spend the coin, which burns it and creates a new coin for the recipient

Coins don't carry transaction history by default. When you receive a coin, it's "clean." There's no way to trace where it came from or link it to previous transactions.

# Benefits of Firo
The biggest problem with Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies is coin taint. If you receive Bitcoin that was previously used in illegal activities, your coins might be flagged by exchanges. This creates a situation where some bitcoins are worth less than others.

Firo solves this completely. Since coins don't carry transaction history, there's no such thing as "tainted" coins. Every Firo coin is identical to every other Firo coin.

# Conclusion
Firo represents a mature approach to cryptocurrency privacy. Instead of bolting privacy features onto an existing system, they've designed the entire protocol around privacy from the ground up.

The combination of no trusted setup, large anonymity sets, zero-knowledge proofs, and IP address protection creates a system that provides strong privacy guarantees. The fact that coins don't carry transaction history is particularly elegant. It solves the fungibility problem that most cryptocurrencies have.

For anyone interested in financial privacy, Firo is worth looking at. The Spark protocol shows that it's possible to have both strong privacy and trustless operation.
